Here be dragons.

## Global usage (BROKEN FOR NOW DO NOT USE)

npm
`npm install -g railway`

yarn
`yarn global add railway`

brew
`coming soon`

Commands:

`railway --help`

Railway will tell you how to create new projects, connect to existing projects, etc


## Local Usage

```
yarn install
yarn railway open
yarn start
```

You should see a list of posts from the db.

You can edit posts in Railway and they will be reflected.

So easy!

### Configuring your own project

The project that's currently setup is a dummy project. e.g: You're all editing the same data since this project hasn't been claimed by anybody.

To setup your own:

1. Delete the .railway/ directory
2. run `yarn run railway init`
3. Follow the prompts to either import a project from dashboard or create a new one.
4. On line 3 of index.js, change it from `SELECT * from posts` to `SELECT NOW()`.
5. `yarn railway open` to pop open your project
6. `yarn railway run src/index.js` to start running your server

Now you're operating on your own project. If you press Cmd + K in the dashboard, you can provision new plugins. Spoiler: Only postgres is supported ATM.
You can also type "dummy" and select "Generate Dummy Data" to prefill your tables with some dummy data
