# Redis Example

This example connects to a Redis database with
[node-redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node-redis).

## ✨ Features

- Redis
- NodeJS

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- [Create a Railway project with the Redis plugin](https://railway.app/project?plugins=redis)
- Connect to your Railway project with `railway init`
- Run this example with `railway run railway start`

## 📝 Notes

In `src/index.js` we connect to a Redis database and create a string value with
the key "hello". We then display all keys in the database.

You can edit the Redis keys in the Railway dashboard with `railway open`.
